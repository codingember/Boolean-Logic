Project 1: Boolean Logic is a foundational exploration into the principles of digital logic and Boolean algebra. In this project, I built a practical framework to demonstrate how simple Boolean expressions can be translated into logic circuits. I implemented key logic gate operations—such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR—using well-structured code and visual representations. The project began with creating truth tables to analyze and validate the behavior of each individual logic gate, and then advanced to the design of composite circuits that merge multiple operations to perform more complex functions.

By simulating real-world circuit behavior, this project not only reinforced my understanding of Boolean algebra, but also provided insight into optimizing and simplifying logical expressions for efficiency. The code was developed using modular programming techniques, ensuring that each logic component was reusable and well-documented, and paving the way for its integration into more advanced digital systems projects. This hands-on experience with Boolean logic laid the groundwork for deeper investigations into computer architecture and embedded systems, illustrating how abstract mathematical principles are applied to build reliable, scalable computing solutions.
